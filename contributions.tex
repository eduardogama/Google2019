The main contribution is the design of a hierarchical DASH-based adaptive streaming delivery system in order to optimize current and future video delivery services and enhance the stream's quality. Such video delivery services will be deployed taking into considerations key challenges in smart cities in order to efficiently use the urban infrastructure. This project is part of the InterSCity\footnote{\url{http://interscity.org}} project, from which data from real-world scenarios will be obtained as input for evaluation of the system proposed in this project.
